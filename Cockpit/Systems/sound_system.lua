        be sure to set any engine sounds as originating well behind the pilot's head.

        ENGINE SOUNDS
  		= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

        Loud, large-frequency spectrum sounds can easily damage your hearing.
        Be mindful of how loud you set sounds like this.
        Be mindful of how loud you set your volume in DCS World.
        Take regular breaks to give your ears and your brain a break.

        The engine has two signature tones, with a baseline curve across RPM.
        
        a LOW tone: 
        curve = {0.30, 0.61, 0.85, 1.00, 1.04, 1.09, 1.13},
        
        and a HIGH tone:
        curve = {0.30, 0.61, 0.85, 0.99, 1.10, 1.21, 1.33},

        These sounds are listed in the order they become audible 
        as the engine starts up and moves toward taxi and takeoff.
        Gain volumes are set quite high, as this assists in drowning out
        the default SU-25T engine sound scheme. DCS' sound engine 
        prevents any digital clipping by automatically lowering the mix 
        of lower-gain sounds, so in addition to volume, this variable 
        should also be thought of as a kind of priority.

        Interior mixing is less smooth and creates more pilot-significance.
        Special attention should be paid so important engine-start-up events or
        other performance changes in the air can be detected by sound.

        In order to maintain consistency when the pilot opens the canopy, 
		asset signature frequencies and pitch curves should be replicated 
		on the exterior sound set, see: 
        /Sounds/Sounders/Aircraft/Engines/Engine.lua

        Ensure engine sounds originate at least 1.5 meteers  
        from behind the pilot head position. This prevents sounds
        jumping from one ear to the other.
